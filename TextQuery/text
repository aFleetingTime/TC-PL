She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired, freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the Earth, it has no time to flow down the spout.
We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart. We all waited, some patiently, others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.
我们都站在沃尔玛门口的遮篷下。大家都在等待，有人很耐心，有人很烦躁，因为老天在给他们本已忙碌的一天添乱。雨天总引起我的遐思。我出神地听着、看着老天冲刷洗涤这世界的污垢和尘埃，孩时无忧无虑地在雨中奔跑玩水的记忆汹涌而至，暂时缓解了我一天的焦虑。
Her voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in, “Mom, let's run through the rain." she said.
小女孩甜美的声音打破了这令人昏昏欲睡的气氛，“妈妈，我们在雨里跑吧。”她说。
"What?" Mom asked.
“什么？”母亲问。
"No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit." Mom replied.
“不，亲爱的，我们等雨小一点再走。”母亲回答说。
This young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain."
过了一会小女孩又说：“妈妈，我们跑出去吧。”
"We'll get soaked if we do." Mom said.
“这样的话我们会湿透的。”母亲说。
"No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning," the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm."
“不会的，妈妈。你今天早上不是这样说的。”小女孩一边说一边拉着母亲的手。
"This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?"
“今天早上？我什么时候说过我们淋雨不会湿啊？”
"Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!"
“你不记得了吗？你和爸爸谈他的癌症时，你不是说‘如果上帝让我们闯过这一关，那我们就没有什么过不去。’”
The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say.
